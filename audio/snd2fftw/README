samples
#######
Now only wave format are supported by snd2fftw.
Bellow is the features of test samples.

Wave type       : Sine wav
Format          : wave, signed 16 bit, little endian
Sample Rate     : 44100Hz
Channel         : Mono
Duration        : 5s

Test frequencies includes:
   100  Hz
   250  Hz
   440  Hz
 1,000  Hz
10,000  Hz

The range of hearing for a healthy human being is 20Hz to 20kHz.
So more frequencies to be added.
